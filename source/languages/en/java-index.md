## Quick start

Assuming that you're running Riak on `localhost` on the default ports, getting started is as simple as:

```java
// create a client (see Configuration below in this README for more details)
IRiakClient riakClient = RiakFactory.pbcClient(); //or RiakFactory.httpClient();

// create a new bucket
Bucket myBucket = riakClient.createBucket("myBucket").execute();

// add data to the bucket
myBucket.store("key1", "value1").execute();

//fetch it back
IRiakObject myData = myBucket.fetch("key1").execute();

// you can specify extra parameters to the store operation using the
// fluent builder style API
myData = myBucket.store("key1", "value2").returnBody(true).execute();

// delete
myBucket.delete("key1").rw(3).execute();
```

## Some History

This riak-java-client API is new. Prior to this version there were two separate clients---one for protocol buffers and one for REST---both in the same library and both with very different APIs.

### Deprecated

The REST client (which can still be used directly) has been moved to

```java
com.basho.riak.client.http.RiakClient
```

Please note that a deprecated RiakClient still exists at

```java
com.basho.riak.client.RiakClient
```

and will continue to exist there several releases into the future in order to ease transition. All of the REST clientâ€™s HTTP-specific classes have been moved to

```java
com.basho.riak.client.http.*
```

and the originals have been retained but deprecated. If you wish to use the legacy, low-level client directly, please use the newly packaged version. The deprecated classes will be deleted in an upcoming release for the sake of cleaning up the namespaces.

At that time, `IRiak*` will become `Riak*` and any `I*` names will be deprecated and later dropped. We apologize for the unwieldy naming conventions in the short term.
